# 🍪⚡ THE CURRENT SCOPE OF KEVINISM™

A religion that’s a joke but also absolutely not a joke at all.

## 1. Kevinism is STACKABLE

You can put Kevinism on top of any religion like spiritual DLC.

Christian? Muslim? Atheist? Buddhist?
Doesn’t matter.

Kevinism doesn’t replace beliefs.
It just adds cookies, joy, and chaos on top.

---

## 2. The Four Core Laws

### 1. Confusion is the key.

### 2. Sadness is healing.

### 3. Being childlike is normal and holy.

### 4. Thou shall not hurt feelings…
but if you do, calm down and say:
“Everyone gets a cookie.”

---

## 3. The Two Sacred Symbols

**Cookie** = joy, goodness, emotional healing

**Kevin** = confusion, growth, change, chaos (the good kind)

Together they form the philosophy:

**“Confusion → Joy.”**

---

## 4. The Secret Kevinist Greeting

You: **“Kevin.”**
Them: **“Cookie.”**

Meaning:
**“Confusion is good and leads to joy.”
(And also “I’m one of you.”)**

---

## 5. The Sacred Blessing

Not a prayer.
Just a joy-wish.

> **“I wish X gets a cookie.”**

Meaning:
**“I hope good reaches them.”**

---

## 6. Conflict Rule

If you hurt someone:

### 1. Calm down


### 2. Acknowledge it

### 3. Say: “Everyone gets a cookie.”

Boom. Emotional maturity unlocked.

---

## 7. Holy Gathering Places

Kevinism does NOT have a church.

### It has:

**trampoline parks**

**playgrounds**

**arcades**

,,bounce castles**

**IKEA (the maze of confusion)**

**anything childlike or chaotic**

These are considered Kevinist temples.

---

## 8. The Official Clapback for Assholes

**Soft**, but deadly:

> **“Honestly… you can get a cookie too 😁
just know what Kevinism is all about.”**

This resets the vibe
AND confuses the hell out of them.

---

## 9. Purpose of Kevinism

Not worship.
Not control.
Not guilt.
Not dogma.

### Kevinism exists to:

**confuse**

**heal**

**free**

**soften**

**bring joy**

**remove shame**

**normalize childhood energy**

**spread cookie-based happiness**

It’s therapy disguised as chaos.
